<h2> 1. Stop gninnipS My sdroW! </h1>
<p> Write a function that takes in a string of one or more words, and returns the same string, but with all five or more letter words reversed (Just like the name of this Kata). Strings passed in will consist of only letters and spaces. Spaces will be included only when       more than one word is present.

<h2> 2. Narcissistic Number </h1>
<p> A Narcissistic Number (or Armstrong Number) is a positive number which is the sum of its own digits, each raised to the power of the number of digits in a given base. In this Kata, we will restrict ourselves to decimal (base 10).
For example, take 153 (3 digits), which is narcissistic:

    1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153
